# OOP pillars

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm **focused on representing data through _objects_ and _classes_**, with JAVA serving as a notable example. In this paradigm, classes act as templates, offering abstraction without memory consumption. Objects, instances of classes, are tangible entities that occupy memory space.

### Access Modifier

The access modifier of a method dictates its visibility to other classes and controls access levels. Common modifiers are `public` (accessible by any class), `private` (restricted to its own class), `protected` (accessible within its package and by subclasses), and `package-private` (default, limiting access to classes within the same package).

### The Return Type

The return type in a method specifies the data type of the value the method will provide after execution. If the method doesn't yield any value, the return type is designated as `void`. Otherwise, it can be any data type such as **_int_, _String_, _boolean_, or any _object type_.**

### Method Name

The method name, acting as the identifier for reference, should adhere to language-specific naming conventions. **Typically starting with a _lowercase letter_**, it often takes the form of a verb or verb phrase **indicating the _operation performed by the method_**, like `calculateTotal`, `printDetails`, or `isEmpty`.

### Parameter List

Parameters in a method are a sequence of variables enclosed in parentheses `()`, serving as **_inputs for the method's operation_**. Each parameter is defined with a data type and an identifier name, and multiple parameters are separated by commas.

### Exception List

Certain programming languages, such as Java, permit methods to declare a list of exceptions they may throw during execution. This list, part of the method signature, is specified with the `throws` keyword, followed by the types of exceptions. **It serves to notify method callers about _potential exceptions_**, prompting them to include appropriate exception-handling code.

### Method Body

The method body, enclosed in braces `{}`, **houses the code that defines the method's functionality**. Comprising a sequence of statements, this code is executed when the method is called. Within the method body, the actual logic is implemented, involving manipulation of variables, invocation of other methods, execution of loops, and the generation of a return value if applicable.

> OOPS moves around its four most important pillars. These are; **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation**.
