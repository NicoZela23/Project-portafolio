# OOP pillars

## OOP Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm **focused on representing data through _objects_ and _classes_**, with JAVA serving as a notable example. In this paradigm, classes act as templates, offering abstraction without memory consumption. Objects, instances of classes, are tangible entities that occupy memory space.

### Access Modifier

The access modifier of a method dictates its visibility to other classes and controls access levels. Common modifiers are **public** (accessible by any class), **private** (restricted to its own class), **protected** (accessible within its package and by subclasses), and **package-private** (default, limiting access to classes within the same package).
